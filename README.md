# Bathroom_Accessibility_
## Bathroom Finder
 A website that locates nearby bathrooms based on user specifications.
## Motivation
Bathrooms are a vital part of our daily lives, but there are not many tools to make bathrooms easily accessible to others, especially if they have specific needs.
## Functions
Our website provides a map centered at your location (which shows as a blue marker), with nearby bathrooms showing up as red markers with pop up info windows. Checkboxes allow users to filter through the bathroom database and select bathrooms based on specifications such as if it's unisex, accessible and/or has a diaper changing table. A search bar is also provided if the user wants to go to a specific location on the map. Other pages include: Bathroom Database, Our Mission, Submit a New Bathroom, About Us, and Resources.
